Ukraine United
==============

Media in Ukraine and especially in Russia is often purposefully
inflammatory and divisive. Public does not trust it, yet readily
consumes the programming where people with opposing political
opinion get demonized and stigmatized. In-depth analysis in
English is rare and often incomplete. Overall, as the conflict
is escalating and the emotions are running high, people are
rapidly losing the ability to listen to each other.

Ukraine United has no precedent in the mainstream media,
as it shows contemporary Ukraine from a unique perspective.
It consists of interviews of people from every region of Ukraine,
and from different social, religious, and political statuses.
They speak about the Maidan revolution, the annexation of Crimea,
the war in the Eastern Ukraine, and the possible resolution of this crisis.

Ukraine United is a platform where people can read each other's
opinion and realize that they can disagree but still find common
ground. We want everyone to use their own judgement about the
situation in Ukraine instead of consuming unprofessional reporting
and blunt propaganda.
